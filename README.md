Building a Face Detector & Age Group Predictor App
==========
This application, designed as a protoype, detects a person's face within an image and 
predicts their age group. A practical use of this app would be in a retail environment, 
where cameras can predict customers' ages and derive analytic data for target consumers. 

This project programmed completely in Python utilizes the following tools:
  * Tensorflow (CNN model)
  * OpenCV (HAAR Cascade)
  * scikit-learn (logistic regression classifier)


The HAAR Cascade algorithm is used to detect faces, and a logistic regression classifier 
is used as the age-predictive model. Additionally, a CNN model has also been trained to 
compare its accuracy results with the logistic regression classifier's.
