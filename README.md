Building a Face Detector & Age Group Predictor App
==========
This application detects a person's face within an image and predicts their age group. A practical use of this app would be in a retail environment, where cameras can predict customers' ages and derive analytic data for target consumers. 

This project, designed as a prototype, utilizes the following tools:
* Bullet list
              * Nested bullet


The HAAR Cascade algorithm is used to detect faces, and a logistic regression classifier is used as the age-predictive model. Additionally, a CNN model has also been trained to compare its accuracy results with the logistic regression classifier's.
